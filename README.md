# Amp_Quest
This application intends to provide audio from straight-forward, unprocessed recordings of a variety of guitar amplifiers and speaker companies. The average guitar and music store will only have a limited variety of products
to play and try out in person. Having a resource for demonstrating the unique sounds from one brand to another can effectively inform one's opinion about an amplifier or guitar speaker cabinet that they haven't had to the opportunity
to use in person.

A user of this application will create an account, and be required to be logged in to access the 'Audio' page that provides the audio samples. Users can leave their thoughts about a particular sample in a 'Comments' section if they choose to.
